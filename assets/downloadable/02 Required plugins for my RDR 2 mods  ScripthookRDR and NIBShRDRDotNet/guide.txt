Script Hook RDR2

Script Hook RDR 2 is the library that allows to use RDR 2 script native functions in custom *.asi plugins. Note that it doesn't work in RDR Online, script hook closes RDR 2 when player goes in multiplayer, see details in the readme.

This distrib also includes the latest Asi Loader and Native Trainer.

Installation
1. Copy ScriptHookRDR2.dll to the game's main folder, i.e. where RDR2.exe is located.
2. In order to load asi plugins you need to have asi loader installed, you can download it separately or use the latest version that comes with this distrib (dinput8.dll).
3. This distrib also includes a sample asi plugin - native trainer, if you need a trainer then copy NativeTrainer.asi too.

Concept
The main concept is that compiled script plugins depend only on ScriptHookRDR2.dll, so when the game updates the only thing that user must do in order to make scripts working again is to update script hook runtime (i.e. ScriptHookRDR2.dll).
