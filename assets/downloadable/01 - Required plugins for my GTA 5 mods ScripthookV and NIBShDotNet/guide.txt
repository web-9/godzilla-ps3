Script Hook V

Script Hook V is the library that allows to use GTA V script native functions in custom *.asi plugins. Note that it doesn't work in GTA Online, script hook closes GTA V when player goes in multiplayer, see details in the readme.

This distrib also includes the latest Asi Loader and Native Trainer.

Installation
1. Copy ScriptHookV.dll to the game's main folder, i.e. where GTA5.exe is located.
2. In order to load asi plugins you need to have asi loader installed, you can download it separately or use the latest version that comes with this distrib (dinput8.dll). You must delete previous asi loader version (dsound.dll) if you have one installed.
3. This distrib also includes a sample asi plugin - native trainer, if you need a trainer then copy NativeTrainer.asi too.

Concept
The main concept is that compiled script plugins depend only on ScriptHookV.dll, so when the game updates the only thing that user must do in order to make scripts working again is to update script hook runtime (i.e. ScriptHookV.dll).
